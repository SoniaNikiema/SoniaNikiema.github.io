# Github Repository

- Creat a new repository(add .gitignore (R), readme)
- click on the green clone 
- Copy https link

# RSTUDIO Project

I assume you already has git istalled. if not [ GitHub Quick Tutorial for R and RStudio Projects Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaDdlrYKWks/). If you already have it installed go to next

```r
File -> New Project -> version control -> git
```
- Paste the https link click on (`keep empty file`)

- Create project
- Before you do anything, staged your (`.igitinore & name.Rproj`). I assume you already has blogdown istalled. if not read [ Alison Hillâ€™s tutorial here is the best place to get started](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/). If you already have it installed go to next

```r
staged: .igitinore & name.Rproj -> commit ->  push
```

- run 

```r
library(blogdown)
blogdown::new_site()
```


```r
blogdown::stop_server()
```

```r
install_theme("gcushen/hugo-academic", theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)
```


```r
blogdown::build_site()
```
Be patient and gave it some time to run the above script

```r
blogdown::serve_site()
```

```r
blogdown::stop_server()
```

- Start editing your site from (`content/`) then push (`public/`) . Sometime it can be tedious to push (`public/`) through git and commit. Instead go to next

```r
tool -> shell -type: git add public/*
```
It should look like this (`\SoniaNikiema.github.io>git add public/*`)

Then commit and push 

- Edit (`content/home/hero.md`)

# Deployed with Netlify

- go to [ Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and register with github

```r
New site from git -> Authorize Netlify by Netlify -> Select your blogdown site repository -> click Install -> Enter your Github password -> Click Confirm password
```
- After you confirm password, your working window may disappear, but don't worry go back to your Netlify account and do these steps

```r
New site from git -> Select your blogdown site repository -> Build command(hugo) -> Publish directory(public) -> Click on show advance -> click on New variable -> key(HUGO_VERSION) -> Value() -> Click on Deploy site
```
If the deploy failed don't worry do to next

Go to your Rblogdown and push all necessary files to github and and repete the process on Netlify

```r
New site from git -> Select your blogdown site repository -> Build command(hugo) -> Publish directory(public) -> Click on show advance -> click on New variable -> key(HUGO_VERSION) -> Value() -> Click on Deploy site
```
Once you successfully deployed Then go back to your R project and continue to edit your site

# RSTUDIO Project Big Clean Up

## Edit content/authors/admin

- copy your resume to `static/media/resume.pdf`

FYI: you can insert all your pictures to `content/home/gallery`

# Create a post

```r
 blogdown::new_post(title = "my first content", 
                     ext = '.Rmarkdown', 
                     subdir = "post")
```
This takes the path to where you want your post to live, relative to the content/ folder (so that piece of the path is assumed, rightly so!)
